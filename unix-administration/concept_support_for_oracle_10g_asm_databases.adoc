If you are using Oracle 10g, the asmcmd command is not available for listing disks. You can use the sql query to obtain the disks list.

The disk_list.sql script is included in the existing scripts provided in the examples directory to support sql queries. When you execute theasmquerydisk.sh script, the disk_list.sql script must be executed manually. The example script lines are added with comments in the asmquerydisk.sh file. This file can either be placed in the /home/grid location or another location of your choice.
