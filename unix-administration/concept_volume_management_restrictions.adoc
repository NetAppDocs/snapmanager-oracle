SnapManager has certain volume management restrictions that might affect your environment.

You can have multiple disk groups for a database; however, the following limitations apply to all disk groups for a given database:

* Disk groups for the database can be managed by only one volume manager.
* Raw devices backed by a logical volume manager are not supported for protection of Oracle data.
+
Raw device storage and Automatic Storage Management (ASM) disk groups must be provisioned directly on physical devices. In some cases, partitioning is required.

* A Linux environment without logical volume management requires a partition.
