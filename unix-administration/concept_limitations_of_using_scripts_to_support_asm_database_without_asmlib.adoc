You must be aware of certain limitations to using scripts to support an ASM database without ASMLib.

* The scripts provide an alternative solution for any kernel version, but only if ASMLib is not installed.
* The permissions for the scripts must be set in such a way that the scripts can be accessed by root, grid, oracle, or equivalent users.
* The scripts do not support restoration from a secondary location.
