Before installing SnapManager, you must know the general configuration requirements.

SnapManager supports the following general configurations:

* A non-clustered configuration where a single host is connected to a single storage system
* One SnapManager server instance per host
* Any topology that includes storage systems running Data ONTAP controller failover

For information about all storage types and versions supported by SnapManager, see the SnapManager and SnapDrive Compatibility Matrix.
